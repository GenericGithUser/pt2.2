                <p>A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea.
                In a sentence, nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object,
                subject complement, object complement, appositive, or adjective.

            <h3 id="iii">>ðŸ“—Proper nouns vs. common nouns</h3>
              <p>One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun.
               A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing, and is always capitalized.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>Does Tina have much homework to do this evening?</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>Tina is the name of a specific person</p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>I would like to visit Rizal Park</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>Luneta Park is the specific name of a park.</p>
              <p>The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common 
              noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning 
              of a sentence or in a title.
              </p>	
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>The man crossed the river.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>Man is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the man by reading this sentence, though we know the
               action he takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.
              </p>	
            <br>
            <h3 id="iv">>ðŸ“•Types of common nouns</h3>
              <p>Common or generic nouns can be broken down into three subtypes: concrete nouns, abstract nouns,
               and collective nouns. A concrete noun is something that is perceived by the senses; something
              that is physical or real.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>I heard the doorbell</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>My keyboard is sticky</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Doorbell and keyboard are real things that can be sensed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>We canâ€™t imagine the courage it took to do that.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>	
              <p>
              Courage is an abstract noun. Courage canâ€™t be seen, heard, or sensed in any
               other way, but we know it exists.
              </p>	
              <p>
                A collective noun denotes a group or collection of people or things.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>That pack of lies is disgraceful.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Pack of lies as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a 
                singular verb as if they are one entity â€“ in this case, the singular verb is.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>A pride of lions roamed the savanna.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Pride of lions is also a collective noun.
              </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="v">>ðŸ“˜Noun as subjects</h3>
              <p>
                Every sentence must have a subject, and that subject will always be a noun. The subject of a sentence is the person,
                place, or thing that is doing or being the verb in that sentence.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>Maria is happy.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Maria is the subject of this sentence and the corresponding verb is a form of to be (is).
              </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="vi">>ðŸ“”Noun as objects</h3>
              <p>
                Nouns can also be objects of a verb in a sentence. An object can be either a direct object (a noun that receives the
                action performed by the subject) or an indirect object (a noun that is the recipient of a direct object).
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>Give the books to her</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Books is a direct object (what is being given) and her is the indirect object (who the books are being given to).
              </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="vii">>ðŸ“—Noun as subject and object complements</h3>
              <p>
                Another type of noun use is called a subject complement. In this example, the noun teacher is
                used as a subject complement.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>Mary is a teacher.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Subject complements normally follow linking verbs like to be, become, or seem. A teacher is what Mary is.
              </p>
              <p>
                A related usage of nouns is called an object complement.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Husband and wife are nouns used as object complements in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, 
                naming, or creating are often followed by object complements.
              </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="viii">>ðŸ“•Appositive nouns and nouns as modifiers</h3>
              <p>
                An appositive noun is a noun that immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it.
              </p>
                <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                  <tr>
                    <td>Example:</td>
                    <td>My brother, Michael is six years old.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              <p>
                Michael is an appositive here, further identifying the subject of the sentence, my brother.
              </p>
            <h2 id="ix">>ðŸ“˜Plural nouns</h2>
              <p>
                Plural nouns, unlike collective nouns, require plural verbs. Many English plural nouns can be 
                formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are many exceptions.

                  Uncountable nouns, or mass nouns,  are nouns that come in a state or quantity which is impossible to count; liquids
                  are uncountable, as are things that act like liquids (sand, air). They are always considered to be singular, and can
                  be used with some, any, a little, and much.

              <h2 id="xi">>ðŸ“—Possessive nouns</h2>
                <p>
                  Possessive nouns are nouns which possess something; i.e., they have something. You can identify a possessive
                  noun by the apostrophe; most nouns show the possessive with an apostrophe and an s.
                </p>
                  <table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#61667d">
                    <tr>
                      <td>Example:</td>
                      <td>The cat's toy was missing.</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                <p>
                  The cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of â€™s at the end of cat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a singular noun ends in the letter s or z, the same format often applies. This is a matter of style, 
                  however, and some style guides suggest leaving off the extra s.
