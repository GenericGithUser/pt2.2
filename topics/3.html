              <img src="../images/adverbs.png" alt="image is either coruptted or missing">
              <p>An adverb is a word that is used to change, modify or qualify several types of words including an adjective,
                a verb, a clause, another adverb, or any other type of word or phrase, with the exception of determiners and
                adjectives, that directly modify nouns.</p>

              <h2 id="iii">>ðŸ“™ Adverb of manner </h2>
              <p>
                An adverb of manner will explain how an action is carried out. <br>
                Very often adverbs of manner are adjectives with -ly added to the end, <br>
                but this is certainly not always the case.

              <p> adverb of place, sometimes called spatial adverbs, will help explain where an action happens.</p>

              <p> Adverbs of frequency are used to express time or how often something occurs. </p>

              <h2 id="vi">>ðŸ“™ Adverbs of time </h2>
              <p> adverbs of time, while seemingly similar to adverbs of frequency, tell us when something happens. Adverbs of
              time are usually placed at the end of a sentence. </p>
