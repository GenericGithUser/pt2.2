                <p>A determiner is a word placed in front of a noun to specify quantity (e.g., "one dog," "many dogs")
                or to clarify what the noun refers to (e.g., "my dog," "that dog," "the dog")
                All determiners can be classified as one of the following:
                </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="ii">>ðŸ“˜Articles</h2>
              <p>The articles are the words "a," "an," and "the." They define whether something is specific or unspecific.
              There are two types of article:

            <br>
            <h3 id="iii">>ðŸ“™The Definite Article (The)</h3>
              <p>"The" is called the definite article. It defines its noun as something specific (e.g., something
              previously mentioned or known, something unique, something being identified by the speaker)

                The demonstrative determiners (known as demonstrative adjectives in traditional grammar) are this, that, 
                these, and those. A demonstrative determiner defines where its noun or pronoun is in relation to the speaker.
              </p>
              <p>
                This and these define close things (in terms of distance, psychological closeness or time). That and those 
                define distant things.

              <p>
                Any determiner that refers, even loosely, to an amount or a quantity can be classified as a quantifier. So, numbers (one dog, two dogs) 
                are quantifiers. Not all quantifiers are so specific though. Many refer to an undefined amount or quantity. The most common ones are any, 
                all, many, much, several and some (these are called indefinite adjectives in traditional grammar).
